# Improv

A very simple implementation of the Actor Model in JS.

## Development

To get started, clone the app locally, and install the necessary dependencies.

### Commands

This project utilizes yarn / npm scripts. To use them from the CLI run:

- `yarn build` - builds the libary with babel and creates a transpiled `lib` directory
- `yarn start` - run the transpiled code
- `yarn watch` - watches for any changes in `src` and rebuilds on save
- `yarn flow -- check` - checks for any Flow typing errors in the source

### Collaboration

This project is actively being developed. Pull Requests and other contributions are always welcome!
